## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guaci Gutierrez. I'm a Spanish developer girl based in London since 5 years ago. Everyday I do my best to become a good developer, that's my goal.

Although my projects may not look awesome at first sight, I work hard to build websites, mainly on HTML and CSS code. As a beginner, I try to do my best to start in the amazing world of web development. Fortunately, practice is key to learn from mistakes and keep growing as a developer.

My latest projects are small apps that users can interact with, integrating HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and React. I always try to comply with the basic Responsive Web Design best practices, testing them to make sure they work well on any device, both on desktop and mobile.
